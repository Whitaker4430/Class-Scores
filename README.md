Class-Scores
============

Point of Program: read and store ten grades and the respective students, then print the highest and lowest scores with the names of the respective students. Average grades for the whole class.  What's Left: I have figured out everything except for one thing: printing out the name of the student with the  highest/lowest score when said student is the the first name entered or "myClass.students[0]". I'm not having issues with the scores themselves, so I must be fucking up strcpy in some way.
